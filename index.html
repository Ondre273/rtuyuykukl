        <h1>What is different about SpaceX?</h1>
        <p>
            Well, SpaceX is a privately owned company founded by Elon Musk, the highly revered private space entrepreneur. NASA, on the other hand, is a government-owned and funded organization. ... And the company launches both commercial and military satellites for its clients. So, that's the difference between SpaceX and NASA.

        <h1>Can you visit SpaceX?</h1>
        <p>
            While there are no public tours of SpaceX available, the Starship building site can be seen from Boca Chica and if you're lucky enough to be in South Padre Island at the right time, you could even witness the next launch attempt in the comfort of your beachfront vacation rental.        </p>
